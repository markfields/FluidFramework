# @fluid-internal/test-gc-sweep-tests

## Overview

The goal of these tests are to enable testing of the GC sweep infrastructure. Ideally, these tests should run for a few minutes. This test is trying to imitate what might actually happen in the real world and provide enough randomness that it will likely catch any sort of regression or bug missed by more targetted end to end tests.


## Tools

These tests can be written by using the [test-utils](../test-utils/src).

Check out the test-utils [README](../test-utils/README.md) that outlines how to write a test.

## Work in progress

Currently this package is still being fully developed and may experience drastic changes.
